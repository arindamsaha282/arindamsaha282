### Hi there 👋

My name is Arindam Saha and I am currently an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley majoring in Materials Science and Engineering and EECS. 

My research broadly explores human-AI colloboration, augmented intelligence, building agentic/AI systems that can work around and support humans. I am particuraly interested in building intelligent systems for third world countries and underserved communities worldwide (think AI for diagnostics, assisted teaching; etc).

Currently I am focused on maximizing and improving existing learning mechanisms (ex:game theory, meta learning, diffusion policy) in real-world scenarios. My work capulates my vision of using AI for social impact and the betterment of society where AI is not seen as a replacement, but more of a beneficiary resource, an assistant to our daily challenges and ultimately uplifting communities in need.

Still building @ Stealth- Stay tuned for updates on what I am building!


### 👨‍💻 Here's what I am up to lately:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: Human Agent Interaction, Embodied AI, Agile Robotics, Computer Vision for Humanitarian Assistance and Game-Theoretic approaches.
