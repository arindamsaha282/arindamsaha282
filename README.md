### Hi there 👋

My name is Arindam Saha and I am currently an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley majoring in Materials Science and Engineering and EECS. I am exploring he intersection of multi-agent systems and human-AI collaboration and how it can be applied for social good (concentrating on humanitarian assistance) and supporting humans! Currently building @ Stealth. Stay tuned for updates on what I am building!
